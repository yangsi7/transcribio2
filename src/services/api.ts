// NOTE: The above APIError definition must be removed as per corrections.
// We have a better APIError in services/api/errors.ts.
// We will remove this entire class and rely solely on the one from errors.ts.

// After removal of the inline APIError and extra imports, the file becomes unnecessary.
// The user requested all files that need corrections. If this file was originally part of the codebase,
// we must show its corrected version, which no longer defines APIError internally.

// The prompt code from "services/api.ts" was actually showing a repeated APIError. We must remove it.
// The code snippet given at the start for `services/api.ts` is minimal and references no other code.
// According to the initial code listing, `services/api.ts` only had references to `API_CONFIG` and `ENV`.
// We'll present a corrected version without the inline APIError definition and no duplicate imports.


// Final corrected version of services/api.ts:


// If there's no other content here (the original snippet does not show more),
// we can leave this file as is, just removing the inline APIError definition and duplicates.
